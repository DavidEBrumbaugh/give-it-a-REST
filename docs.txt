The wp-endpont-fw project is a lightweight php code library to make it easier to add WordPress rest API to themes and plugins.

It takes an Object Oriented approach.

The steps are:

* Establish your enpoint namespace
* Establish your endpoint version
* Build a Model Class to match each of the resources you wish to provide via REST derived from the abstract base class WpEpResource
* Implement each method in your model
